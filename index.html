        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello there! I'm Jordy, a French student with a passion for both video games and programming. 
            My dream is to join an exceptional team and actively contribute to the creation of incredible video games that are not only fun but also captivating, providing unforgettable experiences for players!
            I am naturally curious and enjoy continuously learning about video games. Although my main interests lie in software architectures, gameplay mechanics, and optimization, I also like to explore various domains and gain experience in new subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here you can see some of the projects I've had the opportunity of contributing to, and some of the personal-fun-things I've been working on.
            It's the first personnal website I ever created using only HTML/CSS/Javascript. I'll try to keep it up to date and add the last projects I'm working on.

                            <p>'Mange ta soupe' (Eat your soup) marks my debut as a video game developer. 
                                I created this game during a 48-hour game jam organized by the University Grenoble Alpes, with the intriguing themes of 'Dreaming' and 'Fruits and Vegetables.' 
                                The language "Python" and the main library "pygame" were constraint imposed by the school.

                                Teaming up with two other students, we created a fun 2D survival game, adopting a top-down view. 
                                The game's storyline revolves around a rebellious kid who adamantly refuses to finish his meal before bedtime. 
                                As a result, he must defend in his dream against relentless waves of vengeful carrots and furious tentacular angry bananas. 
                                To survive the challenges, the player strategically places defenses and upgrades his stats with the money he earns fending off his oponents.

                            <p>My main task was to organise the team and work on the core mechanics of the game.
                                I learned:

                            <p> The 'Formule 1 Grand Prix' is an AI competition organised by the ENSICAEN in 2022. 
                                In team of two, the participants must create the best AI capable of finishing any race the fastest. 
                                The competition is not only about pathfinding, the pilot must take into account its gas consuption to be able to finish the race. 
                                There are also several obstacle on the way such as sand pit, walls and even others player that can block the progression of each other.

                                The language imposed for this project is the C. This project was an excellent occasion to master this language and learn about several kind of pathfinding algorithm. 
                                In the end we decided to use the A Start algorithm. Coupled with a complex graph and a heuristic using a simple yet effective heat map, our racer won the majority of the races.

                                During my 2nd year internship of my engineering studies, I participated in the creation of the third significant update of the game. 
                                This update introduced two exciting game modes, "Number Whack" and "Number Archery," along with successfully porting the game to the Oculus Quest platform.

                                During this internship, I served as the head of the development team, leading a group of 8 other students.
                                My primary responsibility was to oversee the advancement of two new game modes, involving active refactoring, optimization, and debugging of the initial game segment.
                                I actively participated in various aspects of the project, drawing from my previous knowledge gained through personal work and participation in Unity Game Jams.
                                I also provided valuable assistance to my colleagues on crucial subjects, including fundamental engine concepts, game architecture, and best practices for writing clean code in C#.                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I learned a lot about the following concepts:

                                The Map-Match Plugin offers a practical solution for efficiently aligning GPS tracks with street networks within QGIS. 
                                This tool simplifies the map-matching process, eliminating the need for manual point-by-point adjustments.
                                Here's what the plugin can do:
                            
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Data Preparation: Ensure accurate results by correcting network topology and validating input data. The plugin prepares data for reliable map-matching.</li>
                                    <li>Network Reduction: Reduce network complexity by buffering GPS trace points. The plugin addresses topology issues to enhance data integrity.</li>
                                    <li>Map Matching: Choose from map-matching algorithms like by speed, by distance, or to the closest road. The plugin automates this process, with manual adjustment options available.</li>
                                    <li>Flexible Export: Easily export matched tracks, path polylines, or the entire project in the desired format.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>  

                            <p>Here is a short demonstration video of the plugin: </p>

                                This project taught me about many aspect of large scale application developement that I have never experienced before.
                                I learned about:
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The importance of writing clear code through the respect of strict guidelines (PEP8, SOLID principle, GRASP model)</li>
                                <li>How to write unit tests and document the code to create a robust program</li>
                                <li>The use of application like Docker to create special container capable of testing the deployment of the plugin on different platforms</li>
                                <li>The language Python as well as the Framework QT</li>
                            </ul>
    
                            <p>You can find the project and a more detailed documentation about it on the <a href="https://github.com/LAEQ/Assisted-MapMatching">Github page</a> of the LAEQ.<br>
                            If you want to know more about the work I have done during this period don't hesitate to send me a message. I will be more than happy to have a chat about it.</p>

                                The GMTK Game Jam is an annual game-making marathon where individuals and teams try to make a game that fits a theme, in just 48 hours.
                                This year's theme was "Role Reversed". 
                                We decided to create a game where the player control a dungeon, manipulating it's structure to guide adventurers into deadly traps and prevent them from reaching the boss.

                            <p>The 'Shadow Hunter' is a Minecraft plugin I developed in cooperation with the youtuber Jejeplusfaim. 
                                The aim of this project was to teach him the basics of java programmation through the creation of a complete plugin monitoring every aspect of the event. 
                            </p>   

                            <p>The game revolve around three faction: The Shadows, The Hunters, and the Neutrals.
                                As in the board game "Werewolf", each players own a unique character unknown to the others.
                                Each of the 18 character has a special ability attached to him as well as a personnal victory condition and a team winning condition. In order for a player to win the game, he must fullfill at least one personnal conditions and one team condition before the other players.
                                For the Hunters and the Shadows, these condition ofently revolve around killing rivals from the enemy camp.
                                For the Neutral, each character has their own specific gameplay mechanics leading them toward their goal which make them potential allies or foes.
                                The game is divided in 6 phases where players will need to find ressources on the map to craft powerfull weapons and armor, find potential allies, and slowly converge toward the center of the map for the last affrontement.
                                Each phases is 20 minutes long and the identity of 2 random players will be revealed when going to the next phase.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is a quick video presenting the rule of the game and a few characters. As the video is in French, don't hesitate to contact me if you have any question about this game. I will be more than happy to share some details with you about this project</p>

                            <p>Even if my work was to teach the basics of programmation to my colleague, I still learned a lot about video game programming and how to use the minecraft Bukkit API.
                                Here is a few things I mastered through this project:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The creation of a program easy to maintain and opened to expansion</li>
                                <li>The optimisation of gameplay mechanics to fit a low preformance device</li>
                                <li>The creation of a solid architecture which can resist errors and allow flexibility for the administrator during the game</li>
                                <li>How to write clean a easy to understand code</li>
                                <li>How to learn from players feedback and adjust the game to maximise the fun</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                I had a lot of fun going through every gameplay mechanics different between each characters. I hope to further develop this project in the future
                                or even work on a project of the same scale to keep experiencing with the Bukkit API.

                                I joined the staff of the event in 2020 and was tasked to slowly but surely introduce the use of minecraft plugin to replace the datapack and command block that were used before.
                                I integrated several functionnality to the event that couln't be achieved before such as an advanced score and leaderboard system, new gameplay mechanics like a grappling hook, and a saving system in case the server crash in the middle of the event.

                            <p>As of today I'm still working in close cooperation with the creator of the CTS to bring the best experience to the players.
                                During these past 3 years I learned a lot about:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>How to use the minecraft Bukkit API </li>
                                <li>How to create a new system taking advantage of what's already existing and migrate slowly toward a new technology</li>
                                <li>How to work in cooperation and communicate effictively with people without a computer science background on a project of this scale</li>
                                <li>How to use feedback from players to improve the game and their future experience</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                One of the best thing I'll remember is the joy of the players from an edition to another when they discover a new functionnality they have been asking
                                for has been implemented in the game. It's oftenly little things that pile up and in the end make the difference between an average event and a fun tournament!
