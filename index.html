        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello there! I'm Jordy, a French student with a passion for both video games and programming. 
            My dream is to join an exceptional team and actively contribute to the creation of incredible video games that are not only fun but also captivating, providing unforgettable experiences for players!
            I am naturally curious and enjoy continuously learning about video games. Although my main interests lie in software architectures, gameplay mechanics, and optimization, I also like to explore various domains and gain experience in new subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here you can see some of the projects I've had the opportunity of contributing to, and some of the personal-fun-things I've been working on.
            It's the first personal website I ever created using only HTML/CSS/Javascript. I'll try to keep it up to date and add the last projects I'm working on.

                            <p>'Numbers & Letters' is a mathematics and literacy puzzle game in VR. 
                                In the number part of the game, the player must solve equations by combining the numbers in the scene using the operators provided. 
                                In the letter part of the game, the player must find the missing letter to complete a word.

                                During my 2nd year internship of my engineering studies at the ENSICAEN, I participated in the creation of the third significant update of the game. 
                                This update introduced two exciting game modes, "Number Whack" and "Number Archery," along with successfully porting the game to the Oculus Quest platform.

                                During this internship, I served as the head of the development team, leading a group of 8 other students.
                                My primary responsibility was to oversee the advancement of two new game modes, involving active refactoring, optimization, and debugging of the initial game segment.
                                I actively participated in various aspects of the project, drawing from my previous knowledge gained through personal work and participation in Unity Game Jams.
                                I also provided valuable assistance to my colleagues on crucial subjects, including fundamental engine concepts, game architecture, and best practices for writing clean code in C#.                            </p>

                                "Endless Awakening: Echoes of the Afterlife" is a story based video game developed in cooperation with 4 other students during my first semester of Master in Computer Science at the UQAC.
                                The game puts players in the shoes of Anna, a police officer trapped in a time loop after she failed to dismantle a dangerous cult.
                                The player must explore the city, interact with several NPC and investigate the cult to find how to prevent a catastrophic event from happening and break the loop.
                                The game is filled with puzzles, fighting and intricate dialogs leading to different outcomes.

                                This project taught me about several key concepts of video game development.

                            </p>
                            <p>Firstly, on the technical aspect, I learned how to use Perforce to share my work with my teammate. As we were beginner on the software we ran into many troubles (bad setup for ignore files, exclusive checkout not removed from part of the team ...). Solving these issues taught me a lot about the software and its capabilities.
                                <br>I also learned more about Unity. I worked on: 
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The fighting mechanics: I worked out how to implement a QTE system that could be easily controlled through the inspector.</li>
                                <li>The tutorial and a few cinematic to better communicate the story to the player</li>
                                <li>The time loop mechanism directly linked to the save system allowing data like previous loop information or items to be easily accessed during the game and saved when leaving it</li>
                                <li>The in-game time management with a day night cycle controlling the skybox colors and sun position.</li>
                                <li>The Dialog system allowing the implementation of intricate dialog and choices all through the editor inspector (scriptable objects, event ...)</li>
                                <li>The audio system with a pooling system recycling unused audio sources or creating new when needed</li>
                                <li>The dialogs UI and the Main menu implementation</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                Secondly, on the management aspect, I learned the hard way not to underestimate the time needed to implement features. We had a lot of ideas for this game and we wanted to implement them all. However, we quickly realised that we would not have enough time to do so.
                                In the end we couldn't find the time to polish some aspect of the games and we had to cut some features we wanted to implement. This experience serves as a good lesson for the future. <br>
                                I also polished some of my soft skills such as: 
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Communication in a project environment. I worked in tight collaboration with 5 other students. We programmed a minimum of 1 weekly meeting to present our progression on the project and discuss about the key aspects of the game.</li>
                                <li>Problem-solving: I had to find creative solution to implement several functionalities for our game that weren't documented online.</li>
                                <li>Adaptability to respect tight deadline: By the end of the project, as time was running short, we had to make choices on what to implement and what to leave for future update. We decided to focus on finishing the main story line of our game and leave the polish and additional branch for later on. </li>
                                <li>Creativity: I had a lot of fun working on the light effects or the menu design. I did a lot of research on it and I'm eager to implement some ideas in my future games </li>
                            </ul>
    
                            <p>I can't provide the access to the repository of our project as it contains several assets provided by the UQAC that I can't share freely.<br>

                            <p>'Mange ta soupe' (Eat your soup) marks my debut as a video game developer. 
                                I created this game during a 48-hour game jam organized by the University Grenoble Alpes, with the intriguing themes of 'Dreaming' and 'Fruits and Vegetables.' 
                                The language "Python" and the main library "pygame" were constraint imposed by the school.
                            </p>   
                            
                            <p>
                                Teaming up with two other students, we created a fun 2D survival game, adopting a top-down view. 
                                The game's storyline revolves around a rebellious kid who adamantly refuses to finish his meal before bedtime. 
                                As a result, he must defend in his dream against relentless waves of vengeful carrots and furious tentacular angry bananas. 
                                To survive the challenges, the player strategically places defenses and upgrades his stats with the money he earns fending off his opponents.

                                During my first semester at the UQAC I had the opportunity to work on a project in cooperation with another student.
                                This project aimed to build a physics engine with 2 principal systems, a particle simulation and a rigidbody simulation. 
                                To showcase the engine capabilities we also developed a basic graphic engine in Vulkan.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Here is a quick overview of the two system's capabilities: <br>
                                Particle simulation:
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Integrator for managing positions, velocities, and accelerations.</li>
                                <li>Force generation handling gravity, friction, and springs.</li>
                                <li>Collision detection system covering interpenetrations, rods, cables, and resting contacts.</li>
                                <li>Collision resolution using impulses.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Rigidbody simulation:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Extended integrator to manage rotational physics in addition to previous aspects.</li>
                                <li>More complex collision detection using a spatial partitioning system (grid) for the broad phase and a narrow phase to generate contact data (interpenetration, contact normal ...) on sphere, plane and boxes.</li>
                                <li>More complex collision resolution using rotational physics and collision form data.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>You can see in the video below a short demonstration of the engine: </p>

                                This project taught me about many concepts of video game development that I have never experienced before.
                                As an example, for the implementation of the graphic engine, I learned about:
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The basics of Vulkan</li>
                                <li>The implementation of a simple render pipeline in Vulkan</li>

                                <li>The basics of 3D rendering (Perspective projection transformation, frustum culling ...) </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>For the physic engine, I learned about:  </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Several mathematics principles (relation between position, velocity, acceleration: integration, collision resolution, Quaternion operations ...)</li>
                                <li>The way to implement any mathematical formula into my program and optimize the code for it to run smoothly </li>
                                <li>Simple collision detection algorithm and when to use them to get the best performances</li>
                                <li>How to quickly implement functionalities for showcase and then refactoring it to allow future update</li>

                            <p> The 'Formule 1 Grand Prix' is an AI competition organised by the ENSICAEN in 2022. 
                                In team of two, the participants must create the best AI capable of finishing any race the fastest. 
                                The competition is not only about pathfinding, the pilot must take into account its gas consumption to be able to finish the race. 
                                There are also several obstacles on the way such as sand pits, walls and even others player that can block the progression of each other.

                                The language imposed for this project is the C. This project was an excellent occasion to master this language and learn about several kinds of pathfinding algorithm. 
                                In the end we decided to use the A Start algorithm. Coupled with a complex graph and a heuristic using a simple yet effective heat map, our racer won the majority of the races.

                            <p>QGIS Assisted-MapMatching is a QGIS plugin to semi-automatically adjust a GPS track on a street network (map-matching).
                                I developed it during the internship I did at the INRS (Institut national de la recherche scientifique) in Canada to complete my 2 year technical Diploma at the UGA.
                                The plugin was published on the official website of QGIS the 17th of June 2021 and has been downloaded by more than 5000 users.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                The Map-Match Plugin offers a practical solution for efficiently aligning GPS tracks with street networks within QGIS. 
                                This tool simplifies the map-matching process, eliminating the need for manual point-by-point adjustments.
                                Here's what the plugin can do:
                            
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Data Preparation: Ensure accurate results by correcting network topology and validating input data. The plugin prepares data for reliable map-matching.</li>
                                    <li>Network Reduction: Reduce network complexity by buffering GPS trace points. The plugin addresses topology issues to enhance data integrity.</li>
                                    <li>Map Matching: Choose from map-matching algorithms like by speed, by distance, or to the closest road. The plugin automates this process, with manual adjustment options available.</li>
                                    <li>Flexible Export: Easily export matched tracks, path polylines, or the entire project in the desired format.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>

                                The GMTK Game Jam is an annual game-making marathon where individuals and teams try to make a game that fits a theme, in just 48 hours.
                                This year's theme was "Role Reversed". 
                                We decided to create a game where the player controls a dungeon, manipulating it's structure to guide adventurers into deadly traps and prevent them from reaching the boss.

                            <p>'Rogue The Dice' is a fun 2D top-down view rogue like / dungeon crawler game that I developed for the GMTK Game Jam 2022 in collaboration with Woondack, another student.
                                The GMTK Game Jam is an annual game making marathon, where individuals and teams try to make a game that fits a theme, in just 48 hours.
                                The theme for the year was "Roll of the dice". 
                                For our first entry to the competition, we created an intense game where the players must navigate through a randomly generated dungeon and kill monsters.

                            <p>The 'Shadow Hunter' is a Minecraft plugin I developed in cooperation with the youtuber Jejeplusfaim. 
                                The aim of this project was to teach him the basics of java programmation through the creation of a complete plugin monitoring every aspect of the event. 
                            </p>   

                            <p>The game revolves around three factions: The Shadows, The Hunters, and the Neutrals.
                                As in the board game "Werewolf", each player owns a unique character unknown to the others.
                                Each of the 18 characters has a special ability attached to him as well as a personal victory condition and a team winning condition. To win the game, a player must fulfill at least one personal condition and one team condition before the other players.
                                For the Hunters and the Shadows, these conditions oftenly revolve around killing rivals from the enemy camp.
                                For the Neutral, each character has their own specific gameplay mechanics leading them toward their goal which makes them potential allies or foes.
                                The game is divided in 6 phases where players will need to find resources on the map to craft powerful weapons and armor, find potential allies, and slowly converge toward the center of the map for the last confrontation.
                                Each phase is 20 minutes long and the identity of 2 random players will be revealed when going to the next phase.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is a quick video presenting the rule of the game and a few characters. As the video is in French, don't hesitate to contact me if you have any question about this game. I will be more than happy to share some details with you about this project</p>

                            <p>Even if my work was to teach the basics of programmation to my colleague, I still learned a lot about video game programming and how to use the minecraft Bukkit API.
                                Here are a few things I mastered through this project:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The creation of a program easy to maintain and opened to expansion</li>
                                <li>The optimisation of gameplay mechanics to fit a low performance device</li>
                                <li>The creation of a solid architecture which can resist errors and allow flexibility for the administrator during the game</li>
                                <li>How to write clean a easy to understand code</li>
                                <li>How to learn from players feedback and adjust the game to maximise the fun</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                I had a lot of fun going through every gameplay mechanics different between each character. I hope to further develop this project in the future
                                or even work on a project of the same scale to keep experiencing with the Bukkit API.

                                The competition challenges the players with pvp, building, jumping, knowledge and more type of minigames.
                                With more than 17 editions, this competition is one of the most important event organised by its creator: Jejeplusfaim.
                                Growing in popularity and in functionality with the years, it regrouped more than 90 players for its 15th edition and plan to develop further in the future.

                            <p>
                                I joined the staff of the event in 2020 and was tasked to slowly but surely introduce the use of minecraft plugin to replace the datapack and command block that were used before.
                                I integrated several functionalities to the event that couln't be achieved before such as an advanced score and leaderboard system, new gameplay mechanics like a grappling hook, and a saving system in case the server crash in the middle of the event.

                            <p>As of today, I'm still working in close cooperation with the creator of the CTS to bring the best experience to the players.
                                During these past 3 years I learned a lot about:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>How to use the minecraft Bukkit API </li>
                                <li>How to create a new system taking advantage of what's already existing and migrate slowly toward a new technology</li>
                                <li>How to work in cooperation and communicate effectively with people without a computer science background on a project of this scale</li>
                                <li>How to use feedback from players to improve the game and their future experience</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                One of the best thing I'll remember is the joy of the players from an edition to another when they discover a new functionality they have been asking
                                for has been implemented in the game. It's oftenly the little things that pile up and in the end make the difference between an average event and a fun tournament!
